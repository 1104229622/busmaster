                </P>
      <P>User can add as many as log files in to the list of Log Files. This 
      list will show the log files that are already configured. To add a new Log 
      file select <STRONG>Add </STRONG>button. This&nbsp;will add a log file 
      with&nbsp;default file name. User can change the file name 
      using&nbsp;"<STRONG>...</STRONG>"&nbsp;button in the Log File Details 
      section. The check box associated with the log file will make the log file 
      eligible for logging. If the check box is not checked logging will not 
      happen to that perticular file.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Log File Details</STRONG></P>
      <P>Log file details will give configuration of the selected log file. This 
      will give info of log file path, time mode, numeric mode, file mode, log 
      triggers and log filter.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Log File Path</STRONG></P>
      <P>The file path text box will give the selected log file path. To change 
      the path select "<STRONG>...</STRONG>" button. This will show file 
      selection dialog. On selection of a log file, the file path text box will 
      be updated with selected file path.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Time Mode</STRONG></P>
      <P>Logging of messages can be done in three different time modes. System 
      time, Absolute time and Relative time mode. In system time mode time 
      stamping of message is done using&nbsp;reat time clock of the system. In 
      absolute time mode the time stamping is done with respect the to the 
      absolute timer that will be stated during connect. In relative time mode 
      the time stamping of a message is with respect to previously received 
      message.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Numeric Mode</STRONG></P>
      <P>This tells the numeric format of log file entries. It has two optinos 
      Hex and Decimal. Message ID and data bytes of a CAN message will 
      use&nbsp;this as a base while format for logging.</P>
      <P><STRONG>File Mode</STRONG></P>
      <P>In Append file mode, log sessions will be appened at the end of the 
      file. Each logging session will have its own session header and footer. In 
      Overwrite file mode the file will be overwritten for the first session. 
      For consequtive sessions the file name will be suffixed with an 
      incrementing number and each session will be logged in new files. The log 
      file name will be incremented every-time when you stop the logging 
      process.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Example</STRONG></P>
      <BLOCKQUOTE dir=ltr style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px">
        <P>If the log file name is xyz.log for the first time, then for the next 
        time the log file name will be xyz0.log.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P> Similarly, if the log file 
      name is xyzn.log for the first time, where n – is any number, then for the 
      next time the log file name will be xyzm.log, where m = n + 1.</P>
