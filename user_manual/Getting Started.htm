								If you are using BUSMASTER application for the first time then the following 
								section will help you to get familiarized with the features of this tool. For 
								this we will operate the BUSMASTER in self-reception mode i.e. the BUSMASTER tool 
								will be the sender and receiver of CAN messages.</P>
							<H3>Initial Setup</H3>
							<UL>
								<LI>
								Call BUSMASTER.exe by double clicking the appropriate icon in the BUSMASTER program 
								group.
								<LI>
									The tool will&nbsp;only work with&nbsp;<STRONG>Active </STRONG>
								mode. Make sure that the USB hardware is connected to the PC and CAN bus.
								<LI>
									For setting the Baud Rate (a.k.a. Bit rate), go to <B>Configure</B> menu and 
									select <B>Controller</B> option. This brings up a dialog box as shown in figure 
									1. Enter the required baud rate in the <B>Baud Rate </B>field<I>.</I>
									<P>
									Other than the baud rate values this dialog can be used to set other parameters 
									like sampling point, Synchronization jump width, Hardware acceptance code, mask 
									and warning limit.
									<P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images\baudrate.bmp" border="0">
									</P>
									<UL>
										<LI>
										In USB interface, setting Warning limit is not supported. The default warning 
										limit value 96 is set internally and user cannot change this value.
										<LI>
											Dual filtering is not supported in USB interface. Only single filtering is 
											supported.<BR>
										</LI>
									</UL>
								<LI>
									To send CAN messages, the messages has to be defined first. For this go to <B>Configure
									</B>menu and select <B>Tx Messages</B><I>. </I>A dialog as shown below pops up.
									<P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images\Tx Message.bmp" border="0"></P>
								<LI>
								You can add a total of 32 Message Blocks having trigger condition either as “On 
								Key” or “On Time” or both. Each block of message can have a total of 64 
								messages.
								<LI>
									You can activate any message block selectively for transmission by selecting a 
									check box in <B>Message Blocks</B> list.
								</LI>
							</UL>
							<P>Message can be added that are not in the database as well as in the database. 
								For details about this refer <A href="Transmit Messages.htm"><B>Transmit Message(s)</B></A></P>
							<P>From the same dialog box one can select the time interval between two 
								consecutive messages by entering the delay value in milliseconds in the <B>Interval</B>
								box. The <B>Key</B> box is used to enter key value for key trigger. The 
								transmission can be configured as one shot or cyclic by selecting or 
								deselecting the item <B>Monoshot</B>.
							</P>
							<P>Close the dialog by clicking on <B>OK</B> button. You can use <B>Apply </B>button 
								to save the changes without closing the dialog.</P>
							<P>
								User&nbsp;can also select the message from the list and transmit over the CAN 
								bus by using <B>Send</B> button or by right click in the list and selecting the <B>Send
								</B>menu. Message blocks and messages in blocks can be added/deleted by 
								selecting the menus. The pope up menu is displayed when user right clicks the 
								corresponding list.</P>
							<P>The message details can be modified even the transmission is in progress. 
								Message data can be directly modified by changing the data byte values or the 
								signal values. Signal values can be given as raw value or physical value. In 
								all these cases all other values will be updated accordingly. You can modify 
								the message details and select <B>Apply</B> or <B>OK </B>button to reflect the 
								changes for transmission. During transmission you can’t modify the details of 
								message block which is active. But you can add a new block or change the 
								message block details for block, which is not active.</P>
							<P>On selection of start transmission only those blocks which is active having at 
								least one message frame will be transmitted. Also if the trigger is selected as <B>On 
									Key</B> then the transmission will start when the corresponding key is 
								pressed.</P>
							<P>Now the messages to be transmitted have been configured and it’s ready to be 
								transmitted.
								<UL>
									<LI>
										Select the menu <B>Connect</B> from the <B>File </B>
									menu option. This initializes the CAN controller.

							<P>A cross mark on the message icon in the <B>Tx Message list</B> indicates that 
								the message is not available in the database.</P>
							<P>If the installation is proper and working then you should be able to see the 
								configured messages being transmitted and receive simultaneously in the <B>Message 
									display window</B> as shown in below</P>
