				  Signal Generation allows the user to configure each signal in database
				  messages with particular waveform and send the messages with these signal
				  values at a particular sampling time period.</p>
				  <p>Each Signal can have different waveform settings allotted like Signal
				  type, Amplitude, Frequency.</p>
				  <p>All the signals will be having a standard sampling time at which their
				  amplitude will be calculated depending on the wave type and they will be sent
				  out.</p>

  <p>Currently only two waveforms are supported, Sine Wave and Triangular Wave.</p>
  <p>To configure signals, go to menu option, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
  normal'>Configure <IMG alt="" src="images/arrow.jpg" border="0"> Waveform Messages </b>and user will be shown
  with the following dialog box.</p>

  <P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images\WaveformSelDlg.bmp" border="0"></P>

  <p align=center style='text-align:center'>Fig 1. Wave Form Selection List</p>
  <p>The above shown figure contains the list of all the messages in a combo box,
  “Message list:” which are present in currently selected database file. </p>
  <p>“Signal List” List control shows the signals in currently selected message
  in combo box which are not defined with any waveform.</p>
  <p>“Defined Signal Waveform List” List control shows all the signals in
  different messages for which the waveforms are defined.</p>
  <p>Use the “Define Wave” button to define a waveform for a particular signal.
  Alternatively double click on the unselected signals can be used to do the
  same. When user triggers this event, the following dialog pops out.</p>
  <P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images\SignalGenerationDlg.bmp" border="0"></P>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'>Fig 2. Signal Generation Dialog</p>
  <p>The dialog will be loaded with default waveform settings i.e. a sine wave with
  amplitude 10, frequency 1 and sampling time period 125. User can make
  appropriate changes to the wave by choosing signal type, desired amplitude
  and frequency. “Ok” button click will add the signal to Defined signals list.</p>
  <p>The sampling Time Period which is last modified will be applicable to all
  the signals. For example, if for first signals you choose the sampling time
  period as 125 and for the second signal, you choose the sampling time period
  as 100. Then the sampling time period applicable is 100 for first and second
  signals.</p>
  <p>Now, if user wants to transmit the defined signals, make sure the
  application is in connected state and use the menu option <b
  style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>TxMessage <IMG alt="" src="images/arrow.jpg" border="0"> Start Send <IMG alt="" src="images/arrow.jpg" border="0"> Waveforms.<o:p></o:p></b></p>
  <p>Alternatively user can use the toolbar items shown below for configuring
  and sending waveform signals.</p>
  <P align="center"><IMG alt="" src="images\WaveformToolbarItems.bmp" border="0"></P>
  <p align=center style='text-align:center'>Fig 3. Waveform Toolbar options</p>
  <p>Use the “Delete” button in Fig. 1 to delete previously configured signals defined
  signals list.</p>
  <p>The Waveform Signals defined are saved along with configuration.</p>
