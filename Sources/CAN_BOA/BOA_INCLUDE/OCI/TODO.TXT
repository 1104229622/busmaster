The following changes will be made before Open API 1.0:

* Introduce Basic Open API header
  - Move OLI, OCI and CSI into sub-folders
  - use generic BOA_ERROR etc. instead of OCI_ERROR

* (Fully) define CSI
  - remove OCI_STATICLIB and friends once the interface
    binding is defined (i.e. remove the duplicate API
    function signatures)

* Define OLI

----------------------------------------------------------

Open issues for the CAN specific part

* The queue events are still not defined. 

* The event callbacks are still not defined.

* The bus events are still not defined. 

* Filter definitions for all event kinds is missing.
