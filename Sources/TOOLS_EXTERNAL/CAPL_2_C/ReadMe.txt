                    Language Converter Compilation procedure
*******************************************************************************

1. The parser file is generated by the utility flex.exe which should occur either under the directory or somewhere registered in $PATH variable.

2. The lexical rule file lexer_rule.l is the source for this parser. The custom build procedure of this file points to flex.exe kept in the server with output file option and option to generate case insensitive parser file.

3. The output file created by this tool is lexer.h. This will be update after every complile of this rule file.

4. The generated parser uses the header file "unistd.h". This file is not required. First compilation after modifiying the rule file will fail with the error message

lexer.h(26) : fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'unistd.h': No such file or directory

** Just delete this include line from lexer.h file and compile again. **

5. All user defined functions used in Lexer are defined in Functions.hpp.
