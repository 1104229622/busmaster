<p>Rank #1: Ethernet and customer protocol support<br/>
With Ashwin's contribution BUSMASTER is able to monitor and analyze Ethernet communication, as well as to construct new messages.
Using custom protocol support access higher protocol layers is possible for sending and receiving, such as IPv4, TCP/UDP.
The Ethernet hardware is addresses through the <a href="http://www.winpcap.org/">WinPcap</a> library, well known from <a href="http://www.tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</a> and <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">WireShark</a>.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rank #2: “Associate different databases per channel” and “Test Automation editor channel selection”<br/>
Andreas's contribution addressed two feature requests, of which one of them was open right from the beginning of the BUSMASTER project.
With closing “<a href="https://github.com/rbei-etas/busmaster/issues/13">issue #13 Associate different databases per channel</a>”
it's possible to have different databases associated with each channel.
The second <a href="https://github.com/rbei-etas/busmaster/issues/711">issue #711</a> allows to use multiple channels in the Test Automation framework,
making it suitable for gateway tests.<br/>
